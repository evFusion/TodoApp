# TodoApp
> This is my first app on Android. 

> It is for creating notes or tasks - such a diary.

In this version of the app there are two activities: first for showing all tasks and to close completed, second - for creating new task.
Storage: SQLite

In plans for future: 
* Implement creating task using AlertDialog. 
* Add reminder with date.
* Add swipemenu and several buttons (edit, delete or other).
* Use other layout.
* Add deleting completed task with dialog or contextMenu.
